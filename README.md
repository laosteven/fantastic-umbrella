## Intro

Within 24 hours, the team must build a mobile phone applet that is able to take a picture of a person and verify if it is an elligible passport photo.

The applet must be able to verify different kind of technical specs based on standards issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) such as:
* Having a neutral expression;
* Length from chin to crown from the head must be between 31mm to 36mm;
* Shadows on the face or on the background are forbidden;
* etc.

Once the passport photo taken and approved by the applet, general informations such as photographer's name, date and location must be filled and then signed by the guarantor.

## Credits

We managed to get a lot of work done by using mcnamee's [React (Web + Native) Starter Kit](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit) which gave us plenty of examples to work with and allowed us to focus more on the challenge.
